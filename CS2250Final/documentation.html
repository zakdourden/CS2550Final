        <h1>JS Event Calandar Description</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Quick notes</h2>
        <p>My project does have a default state with 5 events. If they do not appear for you click the "clear local storage button" this will load a default state.
            In order to load my projects JSON locally you may have to use CMD -> PATH//Chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files</p
        <br>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The event calandar is split between several different files: view.js, model.js and calandar.json. <br><br>
        View.js <br> is responsible for only elemements that have to do with what the user sees on screen. It generates the months and what
        is inside the differnt days of the calandar. It is also responsible for the logic dictating what the "previous month" and "next month"
        button's do. It does not do any of the calculations for how long a month is or when it ends. It also does not generate the events. It is 
        simply the visual components. <br><br>
        Model.js <br> on the other hand handles all of JSON parsing as well as event creation. The most significant parts that make the calandar
        work the way it works is stored here. Event objects are defind here, the interaction with local storage is done here and creation of 
        events are added through here.<br><br>
        Calandar.JSON <br> is a json file I created myself that defines the months of the calandar. The number of days, the month name, the current year
        and what day of the month is the first, all comes from this file.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Milestones</h2>
        <p>According to the project page the following features must be included in order to have a completed event calandar:<br><br>
        A Grid displaying the name of the days of the month at the top: implemented.<br><br>
        Each day of the month displayed in a squre below with an event counter: implemented.<br><br>
        Buttons to move the calandar month from one month to another (back or forward): implemented<br><br>
        Clicking on the day brings up a day view with the events listed for that day: implemented<br><br>
        There are two buttons for the day view, one allows the user to add an event, the other exits back to the calandar: implemented<br><br>
        Each event has several attributes such as: duration, description, type, location: implemented<br><br>
        Game has a default state to prove correct functionality: Implemented</p><br>
        <h2>Other Requirements</h2>
        <p>In our projects we are suppose to implement an HTML5 attribute like localstorage, canvas, audio or video.<br>
        My project runs on localstorage and cannot be used without it. Local storage holds my object array for events as well as
        populating important calandar information.
        <br>
        Ajax: my project uses JSON in order to get the different months of the year. The JSON is parsed in Model.js</p><br>
