# CS2550Final
I need a place to keep this code between machines
in order to make this code work you have to use chrome browser
In CMD enter: PATH//chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
I also did not end up using the "sounds" folder which can be deleted 
The app is now completed and its a fully working vanillla javascript 
web application. The calandar uses local storage for persistance. 
And while the app might not look like much I think the code is 
actually pretty solid, I may use it later for part of a dashboard.
